A list of plugins that I regularly use for Wordpress sites.

<!--more-->

- [ACF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/), create custom fields for a specific page or template. Use case examples: making text editable, images for a carousel or just any custom content field really.

- [Updraft](https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/), setup automatic backups that can be automatically uploaded to a remote cloud storage.

- [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/), simple site translation (pages, strings and medias).

- [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/), basic form plugin with easy wp_mail integration.

- [Akismet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/), filter spam comments, free for personal use.

- [EWWW Image Optimizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/), lossless image optimization on upload.

- [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/), caching and code minification.

- [Cookie Notice](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/), GDPR cookie banner.
