Cron often runs in an almost empty environment.

The default path is very minimal. Therefore you should either use absolute paths or explicitly set the `PATH` variable when using binaries.

Solutions:

```bash
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

# or

5 4 * * sun /absolute/path/to/the/binary
```

If you decide to set the `PATH` variable, you canâ€™t append `:$PATH`:

```bash
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" # does not work
```
